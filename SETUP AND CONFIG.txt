this seems to be a variant of the electron-react-boilerplate at https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org
but it works - breakpoints work, output appears in vscode debug console when i launch via vscode
not sure what else may be different from the main electron-react-boilerplate...

two changes:
    added launch.json based on the one in the main electron-react-boilerplate
    changed package.json "devEngines" property name to "engines" per https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/3648
